# JavaScript Loose Typing and Type Coercion Bug

This example demonstrates a common error in JavaScript caused by its loose typing system and automatic type coercion. When performing operations with different data types (like numbers and strings), JavaScript implicitly converts the types, which can lead to unexpected results.

The `bug.js` file contains code that showcases this issue. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a solution using explicit type checking or conversion.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js` in your terminal. Observe the unexpected output.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected output.
